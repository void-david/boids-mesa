Mesa allows users to quickly create agent-based models using built-in
core components (such as spatial grids and agent schedulers) or
customized implementations; visualize them using a browser-based
interface; and analyze their results using Python's data analysis
tools. Its goal is to be the Python-based alternative to NetLogo,
Repast, or MASON.

## Features

-   Modular components
-   Browser-based visualization
-   Built-in tools for analysis
-   Example model library

## Using Mesa

To install our latest stable release (3.0.x), run:

``` bash
pip install -U mesa
```

To install our latest pre-release, run:

``` bash
pip install -U --pre mesa
```
Starting with Mesa 3.0, we don't install all our dependencies anymore by default.
```bash
# You can customize the additional dependencies you need, if you want. Available are:
pip install -U --pre mesa[network,viz]

# This is equivalent to our recommended dependencies:
pip install -U --pre mesa[rec]

# To install all, including developer, dependencies:
pip install -U --pre mesa[all]
```

You can also use `pip` to install the latest GitHub version:

``` bash
pip install -U -e git+https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa@main#egg=mesa
```

Or any other (development) branch on this repo or your own fork:

``` bash
pip install -U -e git+https://github.com/YOUR_FORK/mesa@YOUR_BRANCH#egg=mesa
```

## Running Mesa in Docker

You can run Mesa in a Docker container in a few ways.

If you are a Mesa developer, first [install Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and then, in the
folder containing the Mesa Git repository, you run:

``` bash
$ docker compose up
# If you want to make it run in the background, you instead run
$ docker compose up -d
```

This runs the Schelling model, as an example.

With the docker-compose.yml file in this Git repository, the `docker compose up` command does two important things:

-   It mounts the mesa root directory (relative to the
    docker-compose.yml file) into /opt/mesa and runs pip install -e on
    that directory so your changes to mesa should be reflected in the
    running container.
-   It binds the docker container's port 8765 to your host system's
    port 8765 so you can interact with the running model as usual by
    visiting localhost:8765 on your browser

If you are a model developer that wants to run Mesa on a model, you need
to:

-   make sure that your model folder is inside the folder containing the
    docker-compose.yml file
-   change the `MODEL_DIR` variable in docker-compose.yml to point to
    the path of your model
-   make sure that the model folder contains an app.py file

Then, you just need to run `docker compose up -d` to have it
accessible from `localhost:8765`.

## Contributing to Mesa

If you run into an issue, please file a [ticket](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues) for us to discuss. If
possible, follow up with a pull request.

If you would like to add a feature, please reach out via [ticket](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/issues) or
join a dev session (see [Mesa discussions](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/discussions)). A feature is most likely
to be added if you build it!

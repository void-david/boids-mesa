"""Mesa Time Module.

.. warning::
    The time module and all its Schedulers are deprecated and will be removed in Mesa 3.1.
    They can be replaced with AgentSet functionality. See the migration guide for details:
    https://mesa.readthedocs.io/latest/migration_guide.html#time-and-schedulers

Objects for handling the time component of a model. In particular, this module
contains Schedulers, which handle agent activation. A Scheduler is an object
which controls when agents are called upon to act, and when.

The activation order can have a serious impact on model behavior, so it's
important to specify it explicitly. Example simple activation regimes include
activating all agents in the same order every step, shuffling the activation
order every time, activating each agent *on average* once per step, and more.

Key concepts:
    Step: Many models advance in 'steps'. A step may involve the activation of
    all agents, or a random (or selected) subset of them. Each agent in turn
    may have their own step() method.

    Time: Some models may simulate a continuous 'clock' instead of discrete
    steps. However, by default, the Time is equal to the number of steps the
    model has taken.
